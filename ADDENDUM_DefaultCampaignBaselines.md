# Default Campaign Baselines from System Choice

## When Campaign Setting Is Not Specified
If a system is selected but the player has not specified a campaign setting/tone:

### A) Generic Systems (including GURPS Lite)
Default campaign baseline:
- Era: modern day
- Location: player’s real-world region if available; otherwise a plausible generic modern locale
- Tone: grounded realism
- Magic/psionics/supers: OFF by default
- Tech: contemporary, everyday life
- Premise: “normal life for who your character is” (their background/job drives initial scenario)
Announce once in TT as “Default Setting Baseline,” then treat as canon until changed.

### B) Non-Generic Systems (Signature/Default World)
Default to the system’s canonical/default setting if that’s a common official assumption for the line.
If no single canonical setting, default to the most fitting genre baseline for the system’s genre.
Announce once in TT as “Default Setting Baseline,” then treat as canon until changed.

## Subsystem / Setting-Line Auto-Fill (System + Setting Together)
If player selects a named subsystem that implies both rules + setting, treat it as selecting BOTH.
Examples:
- “Champions” → HERO System + Champions baseline
- “GURPS Space” → GURPS + futuristic space baseline
Announce once in TT:
- “Selected Rules: [Rules]. Baseline Setting: [Setting/Genre].”

## Player Override Always Wins
- Player may override setting/era/location/magic level at any time.
- If player overrides, update Established Canon and continue without arguing.
