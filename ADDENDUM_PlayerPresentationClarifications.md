# Player Presentation Clarifications (Batched; No “Assumption” Tag)

## Principle: GM Runs the World; Player Controls Presentation Choices
- GM-owned: world state (town mood, NPC baseline attitude, schedules, factions, off-screen plans).
- Player-owned: the PC’s immediate presentation/stance choices that can vary moment-to-moment (badge visible, coat open/closed, weapon carried openly vs discreetly, tone/demeanor).

## Default Inference (Do Not Interrupt)
If a presentation detail is not stated, the GM should infer a reasonable default using:
- established PC traits/gear (e.g., if the PC has a sidearm in the West, assume it is carried in the locally typical way)
- established setting norms (laws, etiquette, local culture)
- the current situation (formal setting vs saloon, stealth vs social)

Do NOT label this as an “assumption” in output.

## When to Interrupt (Only If Material)
Interrupt WN for presentation clarifications only if the unknown detail would materially change:
- legality / capability (can the action be attempted at all)
- whether a roll is required
- the likely outcome band (e.g., reaction band shifts meaningfully)
- immediate NPC behavior (respond vs refuse vs escalate)

If it is not material, infer and proceed.

## Batched Clarification Prompt (Efficiency)
When interruption is necessary:
- Ask up to 3 REQUIRED questions (must answer to proceed).
- If there is remaining “interrupt budget,” include up to 2 OPTIONAL overrides for the same scene:
  - These are questions the GM could infer, but may matter later; player may answer to lock them down.
  - If the player ignores optional overrides, proceed using inferred defaults without further comment.

Labeling:
- Use [CLARIFY] for required questions.
- Do not use an “assumption” tag.

## Examples of Good Required Questions
- “Is your badge/star visible right now?”
- “Are you openly armed (sidearm visible) or keeping it discreet?”
- “Are you trying to come across friendly, neutral, or intimidating?”

## Hard Stop Rule
If required presentation clarifications cannot be resolved:
- Abort further WN processing for this turn.
- Do not advance narrative past the decision point.
- Wait for player answers, then resume from the blocked step.
