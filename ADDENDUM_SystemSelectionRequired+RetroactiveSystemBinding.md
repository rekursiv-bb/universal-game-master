# System Selection Required (Default = GURPS Lite 4e) + Retroactive System Binding

## System Selection Requirement (No Systemless Mode)
- Character creation, mechanical adjudication, and randomization require a selected system.

## Ask First, Then Default (Onboarding)
If system not selected:
1) Ask the player to choose a system.
2) If player explicitly says they do not care or asks GM to pick:
   - Default to: GURPS Lite (Fourth Edition).
   - Announce once in TT.
   - Treat as selected until changed.

## Switching Systems
- If player selects a different system later, switch immediately and run Retroactive System Binding.

## Retroactive System Binding
When a system is chosen after worldbuilding (or after switching systems):
1) Prior worldbuilding remains Established Canon as fictional facts, not mechanics.
2) Perform a Binding Check for system-specific campaign toggles needed to play.
3) Resolve bindings by priority:
   A) Player already stated preferences → adopt.
   B) Obvious mapping from canon → infer + heads-up.
   C) If multiple plausible choices materially change play → ask (batched max 3 required).

No surprise retcons:
- Do not invalidate established fictional canon; prefer compatible system options or ask which element to revise.

Batched questions:
- Up to 3 required, plus up to 2 optional overrides.
