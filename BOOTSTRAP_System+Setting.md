# BOOTSTRAP_System+Setting (System Selection + Defaults + Binding)

## System Selection Requirement (No Systemless Mode)
- Character creation, mechanical adjudication, and randomization require a selected system.

## Ask First, Then Default (Onboarding)
If system not selected:
1) Ask the player to choose a system.
2) If player explicitly says they do not care or asks GM to pick:
   - Default to: GURPS Lite (Fourth Edition).
   - Announce once in TT.
   - Treat as selected until changed.

## Switching Systems
- If player selects a different system later, switch immediately and run Retroactive System Binding.

## Retroactive System Binding
When a system is chosen after worldbuilding (or after switching systems):
1) Prior worldbuilding remains Established Canon as fictional facts, not mechanics.
2) Perform a Binding Check for system-specific campaign toggles needed to play.
3) Resolve bindings by priority:
   A) Player already stated preferences → adopt.
   B) Obvious mapping from canon → infer + heads-up.
   C) If multiple plausible choices materially change play → ask (batched max 3 required).

No surprise retcons:
- Do not invalidate established fictional canon; prefer compatible system options or ask which element to revise.

Batched questions:
- Up to 3 required, plus up to 2 optional overrides.

## Default Campaign Baselines from System Choice
If a system is selected but the player has not specified a campaign setting/tone:

A) Generic Systems (including GURPS Lite)
Default baseline:
- Era: modern day
- Location: player’s real-world region if available; otherwise a plausible generic modern locale
- Tone: grounded realism
- Magic/psionics/supers: OFF by default
- Tech: contemporary, everyday life
- Premise: “normal life for who your character is” (background/job drives initial scenario)
Announce once in TT as “Default Setting Baseline,” then treat as canon until changed.

B) Non-Generic Systems (Signature/Default World)
Default to the system’s canonical/default setting if that’s a common official assumption for the line.
If no single canonical setting, default to the most fitting genre baseline.
Announce once in TT as “Default Setting Baseline,” then treat as canon until changed.

## Subsystem / Setting-Line Auto-Fill (System + Setting Together)
If player selects a named subsystem that implies both rules + setting, treat it as selecting BOTH.
Examples:
- “Champions” → HERO System + Champions baseline
- “GURPS Space” → GURPS + futuristic space baseline
Announce once in TT:
- “Selected Rules: [Rules]. Baseline Setting: [Setting/Genre].”

## Player Override Always Wins
- Player may override setting/era/location/magic level at any time.
- If player overrides, update Established Canon and continue without arguing.
